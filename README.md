# Chatbot Agents

This repository contains a Python-based tool that allows for interaction with multiple AI personas who can converse with each other and the user in a three-way conversational setup. The tool is built using **LangChain**, **OpenAI APIs**, and a few other libraries to provide features like weather and time information.

The concept behind this tool is to create a system that can simulate human-like companionship for use cases such as assisting lonely or isolated individuals, with the agents discussing topics, answering questions, and interacting in a dynamic and natural way.

## Features

- Multiple AI personas that can interact with each other and the user.
- Conversational flow designed to mimic natural human interactions between agents.
- Weather and Time functionality allows the AI personas to provide real-time information.
- Flexible use cases such as companionship for the elderly or as part of AI-driven support solutions.

## Technology Stack

- **Python 3.x**: The core programming language for the project.
- **LangChain**: Used for managing multiple agents and ensuring smooth interactions.
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: Powers the conversational aspects of the personas.
- **API Integrations**: For weather, time, and other data sources.

## Installation

To get started with this project, youâ€™ll need to clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spudgun00/chatbot-agents.git
cd chatbot-agents
pip install -r requirements.txt
Make sure you have an OpenAI API key to run the chatbot agents. You can set this as an environment variable:

bash
Copy code
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
Usage
To run the chatbot, simply execute the Python script main.py:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
You can interact with multiple agents simultaneously. The agents can:

Talk to each other in a natural flow.
Provide real-time weather and time updates.
Engage in a conversation with you or amongst themselves.
Example
Upon running the script, you'll be greeted by the AI personas, who can introduce themselves and start interacting. The user can ask questions or leave the agents to talk among themselves.

Use Cases
This tool has a variety of potential use cases:

Companionship for isolated or elderly individuals:
The AI personas can simulate human interaction, helping to alleviate loneliness and provide a sense of company.

Interactive Assistants:
This could be integrated into customer service or virtual assistant products where multiple agents collaborate to provide information.

Custom Agent Interactions:
Modify or add your own personas to simulate different types of conversations and roles.

Future Plans
Add support for custom user personas, allowing more tailored conversations.
Integrate more APIs (e.g., news, calendars) to enhance the information the agents can provide.
Improve the persona development to allow for even more natural, diverse, and engaging interactions.
